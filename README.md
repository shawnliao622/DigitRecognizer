## Digit Recognizer: Keras + PyTorch

### 1. Introduction

For our Digit Recognizer Kaggle project, we wanted to use more than one model for this machine learning project as well as create some visualizations. We decided to use the Keras and Pytorch models. For both of these models, we researched ways in which we can increase the accuracy in order to have the best working models. The models we’ve created are what we believe to be the best ways we were able to approach the problem and increase accuracy based on our research. <br>

The dataset can be downloaded through Kaggle compepition. <br>
